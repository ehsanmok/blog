I wrote a blog post on the [Modular blog](https://www.modular.com/blog) about building semantic search applications using MAX Engine.

Semantic search goes beyond keyword matching to understand the meaning and context of queries. This article demonstrates how to leverage MAX Engine for building powerful semantic search systems.

**Key topics covered:**

- Introduction to semantic search concepts
- Setting up MAX Engine for embedding generation
- Building a semantic search pipeline
- Practical implementation examples
- Performance considerations and best practices
