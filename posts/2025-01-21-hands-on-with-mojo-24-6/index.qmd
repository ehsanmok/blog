I wrote a blog post on the [Modular blog](https://www.modular.com/blog) exploring the new features introduced in Mojo 24.6.

**Key topics covered:**

- New `mut` keyword for mutable arguments
- Origins system for reference tracking
- Improved memory management
- New collection types
- Practical code examples demonstrating each feature
