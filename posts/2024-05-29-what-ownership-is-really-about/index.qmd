I wrote a blog post on the [Modular blog](https://www.modular.com/blog) exploring the concept of ownership in programming languages, particularly in the context of Mojo.

Ownership is one of the most important concepts in systems programming, yet it's often misunderstood. In this article, I present a mental model approach to help developers build intuition around ownership semantics.

**Key topics covered:**

- What ownership really means beyond the syntax
- How to think about ownership as a mental model
- Practical implications for writing safer code
- How Mojo's ownership system relates to other languages
