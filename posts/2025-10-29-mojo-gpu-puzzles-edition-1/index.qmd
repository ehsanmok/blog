I'm excited to announce the release of **Mojo GPU Puzzles Edition 1**, a hands-on guide that teaches GPU programming through 34 progressive challenges.

GPU programming has become essential infrastructure, but most resources bury you in theory before you write a single line of code. Mojo GPU Puzzles flips this approach - you start coding immediately. No abstract lectures, just practical problems that build real understanding.

## Why Mojo for GPU Programming?

- Python-like syntax with systems performance
- Zero-cost abstractions
- Strong type system catching errors at compile time
- Cross-hardware portability (NVIDIA, AMD, Apple GPUs)
- Built-in tensor support
- Direct access to GPU intrinsics
- Safer than C/CUDA
- Write once, run on multiple GPU vendors

## What You'll Learn

The same Mojo code works across NVIDIA, AMD, and Apple GPUs (partial support). Through these puzzles, you'll understand both the "why" and the "how" of GPU programming.

All 34 puzzles are live and ready. Start with Puzzle 1, work through thread indexing, and build your way to tensor cores.

**Learn GPU programming by actually programming GPUs.**
