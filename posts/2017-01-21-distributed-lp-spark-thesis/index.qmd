## It's Official

I defended my M.Sc. thesis at UBC! The thesis is titled "Distributed Linear Programming with Apache Spark" and it's now available in the [UBC Library Open Collections](https://open.library.ubc.ca/soa/cIRcle/collections/ubctheses/24/items/1.0340337).

## What's It About?

The core idea is pretty straightforward: linear programming (LP) is fundamental to optimization, but when you have massive problems with millions of variables and constraints, traditional solvers on a single machine just don't cut it.

So I implemented [Mehrotra's predictor-corrector interior point algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehrotra_predictor%E2%80%93corrector_method) on top of Apache Spark. The result is **Spark-LP**, an open-source, fault-tolerant solver that can run on commodity clusters.

### Why This Matters

1. **Scale**: You can solve LP problems that are too big for a single machine
2. **Cost**: Commodity clusters (like AWS EC2) are way cheaper than specialized hardware
3. **Fault-tolerance**: Spark handles node failures gracefully, so long-running jobs don't die
4. **Open-source**: Anyone can use it, extend it, improve it

### The Experiments

I tested Spark-LP on clusters of 16 to 64 Amazon EC2 r3.xlarge instances. We threw both sparse and dense large-scale problems at it and measured convergence and performance.

The results were encouraging. For problems that fit the distributed paradigm well, Spark-LP performs competitively. There are limitations, of course. The overhead of distributed computing means it's not always faster than a well-tuned single-machine solver for medium-sized problems. But for truly large-scale stuff? That's where it shines.

## What I Learned

Writing a thesis is an exercise in depth. You pick one thing and you go deep. Really deep. I learned more about interior point methods, numerical linear algebra, and distributed systems than I ever expected.

I also learned that research is messy. Things don't work the first time. Or the tenth time. You spend weeks debugging numerical instability issues, only to realize you had a sign error somewhere.

But when it finally works? That feeling is worth it.

## What's Next?

The thesis includes suggestions for future work:

- **GPU acceleration**: The JVM limits numerical performance. Integrating GPUs could dramatically speed things up.
- **Heterogeneous clusters**: Mixing CPUs and GPUs in the same cluster for different parts of the computation.
- **Better linear algebra**: The numerical overhead on JVM is real. Native libraries could help.

I'm moving on to other things now, but I hope someone picks this up and takes it further. The code is out there. The ideas are documented. Build on it.
